It
===

Overview
--------

It is a BDD testing framework for node.js. The premise behind it is to be as lightweight as possible while making testing easy and fun to do.

## Installation

    npm install it

To use the it executable

    npm install -g it

##Usage

It contains the following functions to write and run tests.

  * describe - The name of object/context you are testing.
  * should - the action that you are testing/should happen.
  * beforeAll - an action that should happen before all tests in the current context.
  * afterAll - an action that should happen after all tests in the current context.
  * beforeEach - an action that should happen before each test in the current context.
  * afterEach - an action that should happen before each test in the current context.

###Synchronous tests

Writing synchronous tests in **It** is extremely simple. So lets start off with an example.

Lets assume we have a Person Object

```javascript 
var Person = function (name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;

    this.getOlder = function (years) {
        if (years > 0) {
            this.age = this.age + years;
        }
    };

};
```

The first tests we could run on person could be testing the setting of name and age.

```javascript

var it = require("../index"),
    assert = require("assert");

it.describe("Person", function (it) {

    it.should("set set name", function () {
        var person = new Person("bob", 1);
        assert.equal(person.name, "bob");
    });

    it.should("set set age", function () {
        var person = new Person("bob", 1);
        assert.equal(person.age, 1);
    });
    
});    
    
```
Notice we use the **it** passed back to the describe callback.

Next we could test different scenarios of Person#getOlder

```javascript
var it = require("../index"),
    assert = require("assert");

it.describe("Person", function (it) {

    it.describe("#getOlder", function (it) {

        it.should("accept positive numbers", function () {
            var person = new Person("bob", 1);
            person.getOlder(2);
            assert.equal(person.age, 3);
        });

        it.should("not apply negative numbers", function () {
            var person = new Person("bob", 1);
            person.getOlder(-2);
            assert.equal(person.age, 1);
        });
    });

});

```

In this example we are describing the **getOlder** method and run different tests against it. 
Notice the **it** passed back is used again.

You may nest tests as deep as you like as long as you remember to use the proper **it**. 

```javascript
it.describe("#getOlder nested", function (it) {

    it.describe("with positive numbers", function (it) {
        
        it.should("work", function () {
            var person = new Person("bob", 1);
            person.getOlder(2);
            assert.equal(person.age, 3);
        });
        
    });

    it.describe("with negative numbers", function () {
        
        //uh oh wrong it 
        it.should("not work", function () {
            var person = new Person("bob", 1);
            person.getOlder(-2);
            assert.equal(person.age, 1);
        });
        
    });

});
```

###Asynchronous tests 

Writing asynchronous tests in **It** is just as easy as writing synchronous tests.

Lets modify Person to make get older async

```javascript
var Person = function (name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;

    this.getOlder = function (years, cb) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            this.age = this.age + years;
            cb.call(this, null, this);
        }.bind(this), years * 500);
    };
};
```

Now that **getOlder** is async lets test it

```javascript
it.describe("#getOlder", function (it) {
    //Call with next
    it.should("accept positive numbers", function (next) {
        var person = new Person("bob", 1);
        person.getOlder(2, function (err, person) {
            assert.equal(person.age, 3);
            next();
        });
    });

    //return promise
    it.should("not apply negative numbers", function () {
        var ret = new comb.Promise();
        var person = new Person("bob", 1);
        person.getOlder(-2, function (err, person) {
            assert.equal(person.age, 1);
            ret.callback();
        });
        return ret;
    });
});
```

So in the above example the first **should** invocation accepts a **next** argument which is a function that should
be called when the current test is done. If **next**'s function signature is **next(err, ...)**. So if next is invoked
with a first argument other than null or undefined then it is assumed that the test errored.

The second **should** used a promise as a return value if you have used **comb** or any other framework that uses 
**Promises** then this will feel pretty natural to you. The test will wait for the promise to resolve before 
continuing any other tests.

###Running Tests

To run tests there are two options the **it** executable 

Options
  
  * -d, --directory : The root directory of your tests
  * -r, --reporter : The reporter to use when running the tests
  * --cov-html : create coverage output in html, if an output path is included then the file will be written to that file otherwise it will defalt to `./coverage.html`
  * --reporters : Display a list of reporters that are available
  * -h, --help : Displays help.

To run an entire suite

    it -d ./mytests -r dotmatrix


To run an individual test

    it ./mytests/person.test.js
    

You can alternatively run the test directly

```javascript

it.describe("A Person", function(it){

     it.should("set set name", function () {
        var person = new Person("bob", 1);
        assert.equal(person.name, "bob");
    });

    it.should("set set age", function () {
        var person = new Person("bob", 1);
        assert.equal(person.age, 1);
    });
    
    it.run();

});

```

###Code Coverage
If you use [node-jscoverage](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage) to generate coverage then by default `it`
will output a coverage report. You may also output coverage to an `HTML` file by passing in the `--cov-html` flag to the executable.
For example out put see [patio test coverage](http://c2fo.github.com/patio/coverage.html).



###Reporters

**It** currently has two reporters built in 
  * spec
  * dotmatrix
 
For the above tests the output for spec should look as follows

```
Person

    √ should set set name (0ms)
	√ should set set age (0ms)
	#getOlder
		√ should accept positive numbers (1002ms)
		√ should not apply negative numbers (0ms)
Finished in  1.002s
4 examples, 0 errors

```

With dot matrix

```
Person

....
Finished in  1.002s
4 examples, 0 errors
```

###Assert extensions

The following methods are added to assert for convenience

  * lengthOf - assert the length of an array
  * isTrue - assert that a value is true
  * isFalse - assert that a value is false 
  * isRegExp - assert that a value is a Regular Expression
  * isArray - assert that a value is an Array
  * isHash - assert that a value is a plain object
  * isObject - assert that a value is a object
  * isNumber - assert that a value is a Number
  * isDate - assert that a value is a Date
  * isBoolean - assert that a value is a Boolean
  * isString - assert that a value is a String
  * isUndefined - assert that a value is undefined
  * isUndefinedOrNull - assert that a value is undefined or null
  * isPromiseLike - assert that a value is Promise like (contains the funtions "then", "addErrback", and "addCallback")
  * isFunction - assert that a value is a function
  * isNull - assert that a value is null
  * isNotNull - assert that a value is not null
  * instanceOf - assert that a value is an instanceof a particular object
